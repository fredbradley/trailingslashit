# Trailingslashit

Really, nothing that clever. Two functions lifted out of the [WordPress source code](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/trailingslashit/) that I personally, find very useful and reuse in other projects, which perhaps aren't WordPress. 

This packages adds `trailingslashit(string $var)` and `untrailingslashit(string $var)` as high level functions, if they don't already exist. 

## Installation
```
composer require fredbradley/trailingslashit
```
